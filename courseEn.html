      <h7>&nbsp;</h7>
      <p>English proficiency is essential not only to learn other courses at school but also to achieve success in the future college and professional life. However, in the current Canadian education system, learners may have very good listening and speaking abilities, yet they may not be competent enough in grammar and writing. Especially in high school when reading and writing gets more academic and challenging, some learners are falling behind and under great pressure. The course is designed to tackle this problem by providing a solid foundation of grammar and writing skills for learners. </p>
      <h7>Features of the course</h7>
      <p>◆ Very small class (4-6 students)</p> 
      <p>◆ “Knowledge＋Skills” -- Systematic grammar knowledge plus lots of writing practice to improve writing skills</p>

      <h7>&nbsp;</h7>
      <p>Reading is thinking!  Writing is thinking!  To write well is to think clearly.  That's why it's so hard.
      English writing, as a kind of precise linguistic output, has comprehensive requirements on learners, ranging from thinking, logic to lexical resources and sentence structures. The course is designed to combine reading and writing, guiding learners from comprehension to composition, i.e. from input to output of the same topic. During the process, learners' comprehension ability, vocabulary, writing skills as well as reasoning power are all enhanced.

      <h7>&nbsp;</h7>
      <p>SSAT（Secondary School Admission Test）is regarded as a must to apply for top private high schools. Globally, there are about 300 private secondary schools (including top high schools in the U.S. and Canada) demanding a SSAT score; there are another 300-plus high schools accepting a SSAT score and taking it as important reference in their enrollment of students. SSAT focuses on testing students' maths, vocabulary and reading; the challenging parts are usually vocabulary and reading, especially vocabulary. For the upper level test,  the required vocabulary is as high as 9,000-10,000, which is a daunting task for most elementary school candidates. Thus to prepare in advance is highly recommended. </p>
